Vs code is A IDE

everything is in tags

boilerplace means the basics for html to work 

<html> is like the actual power point that keeps everthing together

<title> is to name the webstie

<head> tag is everything that helps the website function but you can't see it, You can image it to be like a brain

<body> body tag is everything that the visiter can see, text, paragraph, img.ect

the default boilerplate is !tab which you already know david but i didn't know it was called a boiler plate.

lang="en" puts the primary language to english

<meta> tags, have the job to tell the broswer important info

UTF-8 is just a system for computers to take or store info and is the most efficent and popular decoder or at least I think its called a decoder
the content="width=device-width"... is just to help with people on smaller devices, before everyone on mobile had to zoom in and out constantly
because of poor poportions.
