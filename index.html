CaptionCraft:
What does CaptionCraft do?: Caption Craft takes in a video and uses AI to convert the speech to text, While also being compatible to import as subtitles into your edditing software.

(How)
I Want to have a Header/menu that can expand if you hover over it,
needs to have a logo
Needs a place to insert your file/video
submit or gernerate button
Needs to look professional 
preview area
Title
Button to sign Up #done
scrolling feature





What have I actually Learned?:
<!DOCTYPE html> = telling the website that it's in html
<html lang="en"> = tells the program that it's in english
<head> = holds important information that you can't see but helps the whole thing function(Like Your Actual Brain)
<meta charset="UTF-8"> = is a decoder that makes sure that everything is displayed correctly(it's like the type of crayons you would draw with)
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> = makes sure that the display ratios are correct and cohesive.
<title>CaptionCraft</title> = Title of Website
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> = imports all the styles from another file #styles.css
<body> = Is everything that the person visiting your website is going to see.
<button> = a button

All the links go to the same place (#home), which means if you click them, the page will scroll to the element with id="home" (if it exists).
The text for each link is "Home", so your menu will show "Home" six times-->
